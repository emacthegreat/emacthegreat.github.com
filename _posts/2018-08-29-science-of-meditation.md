Picture someone who regularly practices meditation and I probably don’t look like them. Half the time I’m wearing Vans, a tee-shirt and a leather jacket to head to some bar on Main St, and the other half i’m dressed in some version of a business casual outfit. I probably don’t really act like someone who regularly engages in the practice either. I’m relatively blunt and wouldn’t be caught dead reading a Yoga magazine (not because I have anything against these types of publications, but because I’m rarely interested in them and would probably rather read Wired).

That said, there’s a reason I named this site Meditations on Tech. The definition of the word Meditation doesn’t refer to the formal practice. Rather, it’s “a written or spoken discourse expressing considered thoughts on a subject”. Whatever.

With that said, meditation has been in my life since I was little as both my parents are solid practitioners, though I only started to engage in it on a regular basis just short of two years ago. It didn’t take much, or long, to get me hooked and now I’d say I typically practice it on a daily basis. It became a regular item for my daily to-do list, and I found it extremely beneficial for alleviating the number of stresses and hurdles life tends to throw at oneself which, let’s face it, everyone encounters.

Just recently when I was out hanging out after work with a friend, who works in the tech industry as a business analyst, the conversation diverted to whether wellness in the work place is just a placebo for being happy at a job (spoiler: research shows that it actually doesn’t have an impact in making you happier at all- and once you reach a threshold of being able to live a half decent life, a salary doesn’t hold much impact either. The items that really hit home for happiness at work are autonomy over one’s work and schedule, proper utilization, environment, and opportunity for growth).

“I just don’t see the evidence that meditation has an impact on someone” my friend said, knowing I meditate frequently. “Ok,”but have you even looked and seen what research exists in the first place? Because I’m guessing the answer is absolutely not” I replied, laughing while I took another sip of what would certainly qualify as the worst vodka water ever. Jokes aside, this conversation made me feel compelled to take a deeper look at what impacts mediation has been proven to have on an academic level. As I dug deeper, I was impressed and figured I’d share this on MoT.

There are more than 400 scientific studies showcasing the many benefits of meditation. When I say scientific studies, I don’t mean they’re coming from some BS bluhhhh publications that no one has ever heard of. I’m referring to sources like the American Medical Association’s JAMA Internal Medicine and the American Heart Association’s Journal Stroke and Hyper-Tension. The list of impacts these institutions have listed is huge, ranging from ones that one might imagine such as stress relief and better mental health, but they ranged all the way to UCLA placing a firm stance in their STEM newsroom on how research proves that meditation can slow the progression of HIV.

But this is simply an overview. To dive a bit deeper, it has been shown through neural imaging and electroencephalography that different types of meditation have different impacts on the brain.

 For example, open monitoring, a category of meditation that is about objectively observing thoughts and experiences dispassionately, has been shown to create Theta waves with electrical patterns slowing to around 6-8 Hz (associated with being close to the onset of dreams and memory tasks) and alpha-2 brain waves at 10-12Hz in the back of the brain (associated with turning off certain areas of the brain, the visual system in this instance). As a result, open monitoring is seen as a mechanism for drawing one back and stabilizing them to the present during times of extreme stress.

Other types of meditation, such as automatic self-transcending meditation has the EEG reading how neural connections within different areas of the brain, such as the pre-frontal cortex, are able to better promote better learning and decision making when one engages regularly in practice. This has also been show to calm the almyga data which, when hyper-stressed, makes you react to small glitches throughout the day and challenges throughout your day (a common theme for all of you working in fast-paced corporate environments). During transcendental meditation, your brain waves have been shown to shift to alpha-1 at 8-10Hz, which is mostly observed in the front portion of the brain in the pre-frontal cortex. This translates to the mind being deeply rested, reflective, and wide awake- a very useful state for helping one strive at work IMHO.

I strongly believe that transcendental meditation is great for activating parts of the brain tied to creativity, stress release, and decision making primarily because I’ve lived the experience myself. 

I feel like I didn’t need to write this piece to know and understand its deep-rooted impact on certain aspects of one’s life, but I was curious about the state of research in the world regarding this topic. More so, I hope that this piece can help another experience these sorts of achievements too. That’s all.
