Hi, hello and welcome!

First and foremost, I’m excited to be sharing the work in Meditations on Tech with you. The concept for this project was inspired by some of the amazing individuals that I’ve had the privilege to meet and work with in Vancouver’s tech industry.

With my background stemming in public relations and tech, I’ve often felt like I carried a depth of responsibility to find a way to showcase the stories of the subjects that you’ll read about here on MoT. I also wanted to create an informational resource for anyone who isn’t technical but is interested in the mechanics behind topics such as building a database from scratch, or teaching a neural network how to learn.

It is important that the interviews here work to emphasize how the personalities behind these individuals have been intrinsic to their success.

At a very simple level, the creative talents who work in North America’s tech industry and are able to create the innovation that propels this market forward are often living life on a mongrel team and dedicating all of their energy towards turning their visions into reality. This is what MoT is dedicated to show you, the audience.

So thank you to all of you- those who participated or contributed to MoT in some way or other. It has helped us to celebrate the ideas, habits, and personalities behind the discourse represented by this site.

Onwards and upwards.

Editor,

Elyssa Macfarlane
