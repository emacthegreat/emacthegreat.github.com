Fall is officially here and with the dark and cold weather striding onto the scene faster than WeWork’s fall from unicorn to borderline bankruptcy, I feel like it isn’t unreasonable to ask for a raise if you have to start your commute to work earlier than 7:55am these days.
Jokes aside, cold weather === a lot more time indoors. One plus to this is that you (ahem, *I) finally have the opportunity to spend more time reading all the books you said you would during the summer time without experiencing the extreme FOMO from not being outside exercising in the sun or drinking wine on a patio with friends instead.
Every quarter or so I like to make a list of books I want to read through. It keeps me accountable and I always promise myself that I won’t start the next one until I crush the one ahead of it. I’m certainly guilty of having multiple books on the go at once, but I find that reading one book at a time ensures that I absorb the way more value while simultaneously training my ability to focus on one thing at a time. 
As such, here is the list of books i’ll be reading over Q4 of this year:

#### 1) We Are the Nerds:

This is one I started in 2018 and never pulled through on reading past chapter 3 because of demands with work and travel during that magical time called Q4. Essentially this is the story of how Reddit, a site that competes with Google as my go-to resource for anything and everything, came to existence and was built into what it is today. Personally I’m fascinated by Reddit- it’s origin story, the unique topic conversations that it hosts, it’s monetization - this book nothing reads nothing like Shoe Dog or every-Malcolm-Gladwell-book-out-there does IMHO. I’ve felt called to pick this one back up for a while now, and I’m proud to say that this is where I’ll be starting this October’s reading (after tackling the 1123 pages of Itoi90-/ by Stephen King this Summer, I’m hoping these 469 pages will feel like an appetizer, but who knows).

#### 2) Creativity Inc. 
I was extremely happy to have received this as a gift for my 29th Birthday and only read through the 1st chapter in a spare 20 minutes I found shortly after opening it from the gift wrapping. since then, I regret to say haven’t touched this story and the book has sat on my book shelf for more than a year. In a sort of irony, my best friend and her husband gifted me To Pixar and Beyond for my 30th birthday this year, which I read rather quickly. I enjoyed this book- so I’m interested in reading about the ‘heart’ behind Pixar’s story as I’ve heard that Pixar and Beyond should be referred to as the ‘head’ of the company’s story. 

#### 3) The Myth of the Strong Leader in the Modern Age

Whether it’s meals or books, I always like trying to save best for last. This book is famous for summarizing that leadership is NOT a dichotomy of the strong or resilient versus the weak. It challenges how we question leaders and what contributes to people or citizens viewing them with such authority. Hint: It turns out that despite what we think, it isn’t always the ones who appear the strongest, resilient, or unemotional who win.
