Well over a year ago I developed the idea for a tech site when I had left a job to pursue and education in programming. I decided to make it my side project and mapped out an outline for a year long plan- numbering the amount of meetings I wanted to set up and interviews I wanted to develop and publish from those relationships. 

The great news is that I fulfilled those numbers, which I had scoped to last throughout the year, within the first quarter and a half. I connected with way more people than I anticipated, and out of the ones who I set up an interview with, only one wasted my time by not following through.	In reflection, I can say that starting Meditations on Tech is one of the best passion projects that I have ever started. I was very particular with who I wanted to showcase on the project, and I feel like this was the right choice.

MoT gave me a great reason to connect with some of the people I wanted to meet in the field in a meaningful way, where they were often equally excited to discuss their work and story. But that’s the positive side of things. On the other hand, after starting a new job, I ran into instances where my calendar got overrun. From there, I didn’t make the time to keep working on MoT, and simply focussed on other things that, in reflection, probably made me less happy.  While I might have achieved the goals I set out for the project, I didn’t push myself to make new ones to drive it forward more. This was despite a variety of people, many of whom I had no idea were reading the site, coming up to me and asking when I would be creating more content. GAH.

So while I loved bringing Meditations on Tech to life, the focus of this next annual map is going to be a lot heavier and more challenging as I recognize I need to be a bit harder on myself to build this project into what I want it to be. 

What this means is that a) I’ll be spending a lot more time on my Github account working on this website’s UX (did  you notice I already changed the background?), b) I’ll be working to find projects and people that with align the Meditations on Tech values and brand (see on the ABOUT page), and c) I’m going to be sharing my own thoughts and insights as opposed to relying on interviews alone (because guess what, I’m interesting).

So with that said, I hope that I can challenge you- or someone else- to learn something new about the tech world, or at least think differently about a particular industry or concept. So with that said, stay tuned.
