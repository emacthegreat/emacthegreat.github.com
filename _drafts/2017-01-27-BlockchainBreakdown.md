While heralded as being one of the newest innovations in global tech, I’ve found that many people struggle when they try to wrap their heads around the concept of blockchain technology. Admittedly, before I started teaching myself more about coding, I used to be one of these people. Hence, I made a sort of ‘101’ guide that breaks down the system in what I hope others will find to be easily digestible.

To start, people often refer to ‘blockchain technology’ in different contexts, most often meaning distributed ledgers, or a type of global database. However, it  should be noted that other popular instances often include the Bitcoin blockchain or sometimes the Ethereum blockchain.

The point of the digital network is to create an objective database that can be shared with users for universal access. In other words, this creates a mathematical paper trail that works to showcase billions of transactions in a decentralized environment.

Thus, instead of having one central bank oversee the tracking and storage of every single transaction in the world, the block chain allows everybody to participate in the record keeping while making it impossible for people to forge records. This is done through a type of array called a ‘block’ that tracks the data from a large group of transactions.

This make up allows the blockchain to operate as a comprehensive hard drive where every person has their own copy of the data and, each of which is identical to every other one. When one user’s block doesn’t match the mandated one, you know someone is trying to hack the block chain.

However, the linking of blocks isn’t the only thing that secures the chain. As previously mentioned, the system is decentralized. This means that each computer installed with the software has a copy of the blockchain, which is continuously updated with new blocks. There is no central server carrying the transactions and, because each new block must meet the requirements of the chain, no one is able to overwrite the previous transactions.

This empowers parties (both systemic and otherwise) to interact directly with one another and verify their figures within a financial ecosystem that hasn’t existed in the past.

If this is the extent to which you understand blockchain, the technology can easily be seen as quite abstract when it is actually comprised of several concrete components that are more readily explained on a micro-scale. Perhaps the main thing to understand about the chain is that it was designed to solve a problem that had puzzled the tech community for decades: how to create pieces of digital property without a central authority that governs it.
